# Welcome to the *KNIME Roles* project

## Note
We are moving to the KNIME community contributions, so the latest source might be found in https://community.knime.org/svn/nodes4knime/trunk/com.mind_era soon.

## Purpose
We would like to offer a framework for easier work with custom properties to handle the KNIME roles.

## Documentation
Please check the [wiki pages](https://github.com/aborg0/com.mind_era.knime.roles/wiki).

## Terminology

### Role
Usually some columns have the same function within a table and that seldom changes. These are called roles in RapidMiner for example.
The roles can be used for auto-configuration of parameters, finding applicable nodes ...

## Structure
Currently only the [API project](com.mind_era.knime.roles.api) is available, although a project for the [nodes](com.mind_era.knime.roles.nodes) has been started.
There is a [utility project](com.mind_era.knime.util) for the KNIME related reusable parts.

## Legal stuff
The API is published under the [Apache 2.0 licence](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), while the nodes and utils are under [AGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).
Feel free to contribute.
